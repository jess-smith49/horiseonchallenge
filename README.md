# Description

For this homework challenge I refactored the code to meet the acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The title was rewritten to provide a short description of what the page being viewed is. I changed a few elements in the oringinal HTML file to semantic elements, and created classes for reuse and accessability standards. I also added alt attributes for all of the images. I reorganized the structure of the css file in a sequential order according to the organization of the HTML file so it is easier to read and understand. 

The specific technologies that were used to refactor the code were HTML and CSS
