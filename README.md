# Horiseon

# Description
For this challenge I refactored the orignial code of the Horiseon HTML and CSS files to meet the given User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

The title was rewritten to provide a short description of what the page being viewed is. I changed a few elements in the oringinal HTML file to semantic elements, and created classes for reuse and accessability standards. I also added alt attributes for all of the images. I reorganized the structure of the css file in a sequential order according to the organization of the HTML file so it is easier to read and understand. 

The specific technologies that were used to refactor the code were HTML and CSS, as well as the computer terminal and gitub to assist in version control and creation/deletion.
